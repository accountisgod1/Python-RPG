This project was made for me to test my python skills.

Do not criticize any mistake. Just modify Bugs.txt to show every bug that everybody has experienced.

# How to use

Extract every file from there into a folder, do not split the files (ex: You moved Enemies.py to another folder).

## Errors
 
 # No Such Attribute
   The no such attribute error happens because the command is being built. If you have a specific key to access each new command or use    the command named 'EnterKey' then you can access other commands that is being built.
